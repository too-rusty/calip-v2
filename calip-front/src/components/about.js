            small byte sized cards on calip along with explanations , your
            insights on them and other useful resources from the internet This
            way you promote your video/ channel and at the same time convey your
            message directly to the viewers Although we will be adding the
            feature to upload your own video but this method will be much more
            easier ( you get to be famous on YouTube and at the same time build
            your following here ) Also thereâ€™s too much competition on youtube ,
            we will be marketing and ensuring that your courses are visible to
