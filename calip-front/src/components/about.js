                    There are many websites where subject experts can create and sell courses, but those require you to be expert in a whole subject or a set of topics.
                    Calip is a place for creators to create educational and informational courses/content/blogs via aggregation along with a mix of their own insights
                    There are two various ways to master a topic , but why start from the beginning when you can already build upon the experiences of others.
                    We believe that anyone can create course / content on calip that is useful to others ( and even sell them in the future )
                    You don’t need to be a subject expert to do so and can create courses with ease via aggregation of best materials from all over the internet
                    By using markdown to style your ideas, you can create useful courses in many ways , videos, images , formatting etc.
                    Create a card chain consisting of many byte sized cards , video cards ( cards with embedded youtube vids / twitch videos )

                    Well think youtube playlist but hackable.
                    Card chains are simply collection of cards in some order.
                    Cards are collection of your ideas, website links , embedded youtube/twitch videos ( video cards )
                    and most importantly your personal view on the topic in an order so that the readers can get the best value out of it.
